Force name to be entered (min 1 character) on client-side & server-side (server-side just reject similar to password fail).

Change Broadcast of playerData so it only gets sent to the specific player (e.g. Player1 refreshes, only he gets a message, not everyone.)

Clear previous inputs if client gets rejected from joining (because of password)?

Join/Create needs a back button.

Game needs a disconnect button (needs to remove client from GameHandler and show room list again.)




Replace ugly image file upload button with player-data clickable image, maybe at the side of the player name 
(see https://stackoverflow.com/a/18803568 )


Maybe refactor playerData in GamePhaseHandler into playerData and playerDataSecret?
  - For roles, currentVote
  - Would need to add additional functionality to broadcastPlayerData, which sends each secret playerData to the specific socket in UUIDSocketMap
  - Would also need to replace all instances of secret data (e.g. roles, currentVote) with the other datastructure
  - Would need to make an additional event e.g. "secret_player_data_update" which has to be handled on client-side as well.


Finish Voting implementation with results.
  - Maybe just aggregate the votes and store the result, the 'effect' happens in a different phase
    - For e.g. the Witch, all "Deaths" are announced at the beginning of the "Day" phase. So the Beginning of the phase "Day" looks at a list of all "Deaths" 
      (each death also has a cause for e.g. the village elder role, which survives the first werewolf/special role kill)
  - Clients should somehow receive an overview of the voting, at least on the "Day" voting/lynching. 
    - Just make a "Day Vote Result" phase with timeout of e.g. 10 seconds, where number of votes are shown for each person

Own Player Details have to be displayed somewhere, e.g. image, dead/alive, mayor status

Dead Players should be displayed differently
  - Show "Dead" in own player details
  - In other player cards, dead players are displayed at the end of the list, grayed out, without click events.

Win-Condition on Server-Side
  - Keep track of dead people
  - At the beginning of the "Day" and the end of the "Day", win conditions are checked / votes and special abilities regarding death of players are resolved.





Implement special roles
